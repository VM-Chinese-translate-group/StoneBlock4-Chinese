# Heater Upgrade

<ItemImage id="mekanism:resistive_heater" scale="3" />

The <Color id="green">Heater</Color> is a major upgrade that allows you to pump in heat into the <Color id="gold">World Engine Controller</Color>.

It is suggested to use a <Color id="green">Resistive Heater</Color> so that you can set a specific amount of power to create enough heat for the controller. Later on, you might even use a Reactor to provide heat instead.

This upgrade unlocks the <Color id="gold">Energizing Orb</Color> to continue progressing in <Color id="gold">Powah</Color>.
