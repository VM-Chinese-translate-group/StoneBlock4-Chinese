# Deepshelf Enchanting Upgrade

<ItemImage id="apothic_enchanting:echoing_deepshelf" scale="3" />

The <Color id="green">Heater</Color> minor upgrade allows you to pump in heat into the <Color id="gold">World Engine Controller</Color>.

It is suggested to use a <Color id="green">Resistive Heater</Color> so that you can set a specific amount of power to create enough heat for the controller.

Although this is a minor upgrade, this upgrade unlocks the <Color id="gold">Energizing Orb</Color> to continue progressing in <Color id="gold">Powah</Color>
