# Getting Started with Spectre Energy

<ItemImage id="irregular_implements:spectre_energy_injector" scale="2" />

<Color id="gold">Irregular Implements</Color> adds a great early game option for <Color id="red">wireless power</Color> using the <Color id="aqua">Spectre Networks</Color>.

To create your first <Color id="aqua">Spectre Network</Color>, you will need to craft and place down a <Color id="red">Spectre Energy Injector</Color>. This acts as the hub of your wireless network, and are bound to the player that places down the Injector.

To give your network power, you can pump in power using any of the standard power cables or pipes.

To use the power in your network, you will need to use a <Color id="aqua">Spectre Coil</Color>. Simply place down a Coil where you'd like to tap in to your <Color id="aqua">Spectre Network's</Color> power.
