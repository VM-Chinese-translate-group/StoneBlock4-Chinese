# Spectre Key

<ItemImage id="irregular_implements:spectre_key" scale="2" />

The <Color id="aqua">Spectre Key</Color> grants you access to your own private <Color id="aqua">Spectre Dimension</Color> that is exactly 1 chunk wide. While holding the key in your hand, using it for 5 seconds will teleport you to a small room.

Right-clicking the <Color id="aqua">Spectre Core</Color> in the center of the room with <Color id="aqua">Ectoplasm</Color> will increase the height of the room.

To return home, you can always use the <Color id="aqua">Spectre Key</Color> again.
